Yet another Yogurt - An AUR Helper written in Go

There's a point in everyone's life when you feel the need to write an AUR helper because there are only about 20 of them.
So say hi to 20+1.

Yay was created with a few objectives in mind and based on the design of yaourt and apacman:

- Have almost no dependencies. 
- Provide an interface for pacman 
- Have yaourt like search
- Know when git packages are due for an upgrade
